### Intro
What is shapeless?  Well its a library for doing generic programming in Scala.  What is generic programming, well that is a little harder to explain.  Generic programming is the type of polymorphism your lanugage doesn't support.  That sounds sort of like a recurisve defintion that results in a circular definition.  Anyhow, hopefully it will all make sense by the time you get to the end of this list.

### 1. [The Type Astronaut's Guide to Shapeless Book](https://underscore.io/books/shapeless-guide/)
This free ebook from underscore walks thru shapeless in some fun detail.  I recommend after reading it you attempt to build your own Json parser using the techniques learned in the book.
### 2. [The Shapeless Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/milessabin/shapeless)
If you have questions after reading the shapeless book. Gitter is a great place to go.  
### 3. [Shapeless Exercises](https://www.scala-exercises.org/shapeless/generic).  
Scala Exercises has a whole section of shapeless exercises that you can use to cement your knowledge of the shapeless library.
### 4. [Generic Programming and Shapeless with Miles Sabin](https://corecursive.com/008-generic-programming-and-shapeless-with-miles-sabin/)
In this interview with Miles Sabbin, the creator of shapeless, he explains why he created shapeless and also the why.  The why is actually a pretty interesting story.
### 5. [Is Shapeless worth it?](https://medium.com/build-and-learn/is-shapeless-worth-it-what-is-shapeless-anyway-900cba6b717a)
An article tackling whether using shapeless is worth it.  Spoiler alert, it is if you like type safey and avoid boiler plate.
### 6. [Getting Started with Shapeless](https://jto.github.io/articles/getting-started-with-shapeless/) 
@skaalf's guide to getting started with shapeless.
### 7. [@milessabin](https://twitter.com/milessabin) Miles Sabin on twitter.
### 8. [Code Mesh Kind PolyMorphism Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG00ivPa9hk) 
This is a bit of reach. But let's say it will be intereting to those of us interested in Shapeless.

### Wrapping up:
There we go.  So shapeless is geneic programming and generic programming is the type of polymorphism your lanuage doesn't support.
