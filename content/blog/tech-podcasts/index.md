### 1. [Software Engineering Daily]()
With one episdoe a business day, and a focused format, Jeff at SEDaily is one of my favorite podcasts. My first podcast interview was also as a guest host on SEDaily, so I can't say enough good things about this podcast.

### 2. [Data Skeptic]()
I'm not sure how I got subscribed to data skeptic, as a I'm not a data scientist of any sort.  But I'm glad I am.  My favorite thing is the miny epsidoes where Kyle explains to ??? a concept.  I think it is very impressive that she comes to these cold, from another background and is recorded.  To me that is a frightening endevaour.

### 3. [CoRecursive]() 
This is my podcast.  Jeff at SEDaily gave me the format, in depth technical interviews.  I try to interview smart people about technical topics that are deep and avoid tech news and trivia.  I also try to keep it casual in tone.  Whether I succeed at all or any of these is an open question, but doing the interviews has been so much fun.

### 4. [Mapping The Journey]()
I'm not sure if this podcast is still being made but some heavy hitters have been interviewed.

### 5. [.net Rocks]()
The first podcast I listened to was The Daily Source Code with Adam Curry, but mainly I recall it being about podcasts and podcasting.  .Net Rocks was as fun interview show about .net and since I had recently started writing C# for a living, I jump on this one write away.   This must have been 12 or more years ago and though I don't listen anymore, it has to get a shout out.

### 6. [The New Reustacean]()
Chris has this podcast about learning Rust.  And he just narrates it to the listener.  I think that is just such an challenging and intimate format and Chris pulls it off everytime.

### 7. [ScalaWags]()
Fun group interviews about scala.  No longer being made, but a great podcast.

### 8. [HaskellCast]()
Very few epsidoes of this podcast were ever made, but when they were made I was pretty focused on learning haskell.  I think they should pick it back up.

### 9. [Functional Geekery]()

### 10. [Hanselminutes]()

There we go.  So shapeless is geneic programming and generic programming is the type of polymorphism your lanuage doesn't support.
